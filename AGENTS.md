# Project notes for agents

Deliberate decisions in this repo - do NOT silently revert them:

- `homebrew.onActivation.cleanup = "zap"` in `configuration.nix` is intentional. It forces the good habit of declaring every Homebrew package in the Nix config instead of installing things ad-hoc, which keeps the machine reproducible. Do not soften it to `uninstall` or `none`. Users are warned about its effect in README.md; this note is for anyone tempted to change the setting itself.
- This repo is public. Never add SSH host names, addresses, or any other private infrastructure detail to it. `~/.ssh/config` is deliberately left unmanaged so that data stays local; the remote agent workflow reads host aliases from there. See the remote agent section in README.md.
- `packages/claude-remote-shell` is installed unwrapped on purpose. The header comment there explains why a `makeWrapper` indirection breaks it silently; do not "fix" it by adding one.
- Never commit `.no-mistakes/` validation evidence to this public repo. `.no-mistakes/` is gitignored; if a validation pipeline stages evidence into a branch, drop it before merging.

Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
